############ My repo for Farley Center work ####################

This folder includes the uploaded files by project for the Farley Center data analysis work
that LB has created. Each project will have a separate folder by project for code (usually SAS but could
be STATA or R) ; reports/manuscript files ; and documents (will include output and results).
Raw data is not included in this repository for privacy reasons. Each set of code will link to the dataset
which is shared in the Farley Center network drive.
